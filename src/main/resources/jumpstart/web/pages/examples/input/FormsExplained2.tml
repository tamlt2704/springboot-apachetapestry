    <h3>Forms Explained (2)</h3>

    <div class="eg">
        <p>Welcome ${name}!</p>
        <t:pagelink t:page="examples/input/FormsExplained1">Return</t:pagelink>
    </div>

    Look at the URL of this page. It is the <strong>page render request</strong> we have been redirected to,
    rather than the <strong>component event request</strong> from the Form.<br/>
    This URL is safe to refresh, bookmark, or return to with the Back button - the event won't be sent again.<br/><br/>

    Why does this page have <code>onPassivate()</code>? Well, to generate the <strong>page render request</strong>,
    Tapestry needed this page's activation context, which it got by triggering the <em>passivate</em> event on this page.
    It is the duty of a <em>passivate</em> event handler to return the page's activation context.<br/><br/>
